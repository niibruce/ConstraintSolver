# ConstraintSolver
 Implementation of Constraint Solvers in Java

 This repo contains an implementation of the Forward Checking and MAC3 algorithms for solving binary constraint problems.

 The code is tested on problem instances of [NQueens](http://www.csplib.org/Problems/prob054/) and [Langford's Number Problem](http://www.csplib.org/Problems/prob024/)

 It also includes a visualisation class to visualise the results of the solutions to the problems. 

 Some example solutions are shown below:

Solution to 20-Queens problem: 
![Twenty Queens][twenty_queens]

![Langford's 2-3][langfords]

[langfords]: ./langfords2_3.png "Langford's 2-3"
